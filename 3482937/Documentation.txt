Using The Ability System
First is to Create a custom input object,
This is created in the project, "Right Click-> Create -> keyBindings
This will create a keybinding asset, name it what ever you like
In the keyBindings Asset, add as many elements to the KeyBindingCheck as you want, this will be equals to the amount of abilities you have
Assign a key bindidng action and a Keycode
Make sure these are unique to avoid clashes when playing the game
Now in your player game object add a "Player Abilities" component
This component will handle all of the abilities and the input assignment
Firstly drag your created keyBindings asset in to the "Ability Input" field of the "Player Abilities" component
The ability holder can be any game object on your player game object this is just so that the ability prefabs can be instantiated onto your player
And now the abilities, i have made some basic abilities but only one has actual functionality

To make an ability create an empty game object in your scene
Then create a C# script and extend the "Abilities" class instead of monobehaviour 
Implement the virtual methods from the "Abilities" class into your new script, these are the "OnActivateAbility" , "OnDisableAbility" and "OnTick"
The activate ability activate like a start method, when the player presses the button this method is run once, the disable ability is similar but for when the cooldown time is run out, and the tick is like the update function which runs every frame the method is called
So with this in mind put what ever behaviour you would like in these methods
The tick method only runs as long as the ability is still in AbilityState.Active state
After this you can go back to the editor and add the new component to the previously created game object
Now you should be able to change the default data
Change the "Action" field to align with one of the ones that you created from your keyBindings asset
Set the cooldown duration which is how long the player has to wait to re use the ability
And the active time which is how long the ability will be in effect
You can also add effects and audio to the ability "Trigger Effect" and "Disable Effect" for extra game juice
